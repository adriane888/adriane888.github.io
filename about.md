## Summary
DevOps Engineer with 3 years of progressive, hands-on experience spanning DevOps, FinOps, automation, and cloud architecture. I began as a Junior DevOps Engineer, grew into a full DevOps Engineer role by taking ownership of infrastructure, automation pipelines, and cross-team enablement, and continue to expand my impact through cost optimization, secure architectures, and large-scale repository/platform migrations. I’m AZ-900, AZ-104, and AZ-400 (DevOps Engineer Expert) certified, with a strong focus on pragmatic automation, reliability, and developer experience. I also have a focus in FinOps and am FinOps certified

## Core Strengths
Focused on delivering secure, observable, cost‑aware cloud solutions while empowering development teams with scalable CI/CD and repeatable infrastructure patterns.

**Core focus areas:**
- Platform & Infrastructure Automation
- Cost Optimization / FinOps Strategy
- Secure Architecture & WAF Governance
- CI/CD Design & Pipeline Standardization
- Developer Experience & Enablement
- Observability & Operational Readiness
- GitHub Administration (organizations, governance, Actions, Copilot enablement)

## Key Skills
- Azure (AKS, Web Apps, Firewall, Networking, Monitoring)
- Azure DevOps & GitHub (Actions, Organizations, Governance)
- Automation & Scripting (PowerShell, Terraform, Packer, Python exposure)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines, TeamCity management)

## Professional Experience

### STG (Software Technology Group) – Contract DevOps Engineer to ASI (Autonomous Solutions Inc.)  
*April 2025 – Present*
Engaged as a DevOps Engineer to modernize and streamline development workflows and cloud readiness for ASI.
- Migrated 150+ repositories from Bitbucket to GitHub using custom automation tooling (reducing manual effort, enforcing consistent naming and branching standards).
- Established DevOps best practices: branching strategies, PR review guidelines, repository templates, and standardized CI patterns.
- Administer and optimize a TeamCity server supporting hundreds of builds—rationalizing build configurations and improving reliability.
- Designed and provisioned Azure environments for application workloads (networking, RBAC, security baseline, cost awareness).
- Managed GitHub Organization & Enterprise settings: permission models, team structures, repository governance, secret management.
- Authored and maintained reusable GitHub Actions workflows enabling consistent CI + groundwork for future CD.
- Rolled out and supported GitHub Copilot across the org (enablement, policy guidance, developer onboarding, productivity coaching).
- Troubleshot complex developer issues (Git flow conflicts, submodule management, authentication/token scope problems, build pipeline drift).
- Drove incremental platform improvements while maintaining day‑to‑day operational support.

### SquareHook – DevOps Engineer / FinOps (Progression from Junior)  
*February 2022 – March 2025*
Started as a Junior DevOps Engineer (first 18 months), then advanced to DevOps Engineer by taking on higher-impact automation, architecture, and FinOps responsibilities across multiple client products.
- Automated full CI/CD pipelines for multiple clients leveraging GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and container workflows (Docker, AKS, ACS).
- Managed a team of up to 4 SREs—prioritizing work, mentoring, and unblocking delivery.
- Architected secure, scalable cloud infrastructure (Azure + select AWS services) with a focus on resiliency and cost efficiency.
- Implemented and tuned WAF (Azure + on-prem) to ensure only trusted, known traffic while reducing noise and false positives.
- Built alerting & observability frameworks (Azure Monitor, OpsGenie) with actionable routing and clear runbooks.
- Coordinated with Security, Compliance, DBAs, TechOps, and leadership to align architecture decisions with business and regulatory needs (including PCI 4.0 considerations).
- Utilized Landing Zones for consistent, repeatable Azure environment provisioning.
- Authored best-practice documentation to standardize DevOps approaches across teams.
- Integrated security scanning (Mend, Veracode) into pipelines; provided remediation guidance.
- Generated FinOps reports driving strategic OpEx reductions and spend accountability.
- Provided guidance on secure and private network architectures and segmentation.

## Career Progression Snapshot
- 1.5 years: Junior DevOps Engineer (foundation building—pipelines, scripting, infra basics)
- 1.5 years: DevOps Engineer (ownership of platforms, automation scale-out, FinOps & security integration)
- Current: DevOps Engineer (contract) focusing on large-scale migration, governance, and developer experience enablement.

## Education
- Uintah High School – High School Diploma (2016)
- Apprenticeship: 2-year DevOps apprenticeship under Senior DevOps Engineer KC Hansen

## What Drives Me
I like solving messy infrastructure and workflow problems—turning ad hoc processes into automated, observable, and cost‑efficient systems. I’m motivated by empowering engineers with fast feedback loops, secure defaults, and clear documentation.
