Hi, Iâ€™m Adriane. The primary hat I wear in my professional life is DevOps Engineer â€” which can mean... well, almost anything. My main focus areas are CI/CD automation, GitHub administration, cloud architecture, and (these days) a splash of AI everything. For more on my career, check out my resume **[here](/resume/)**. If youâ€™re interested in any of those topics, browse the blog â€” you might find something informative your LLM hasnâ€™t told you yet ðŸ˜‰.

### Personal Life

I like to run, lift weights, and do whatever my girlfriend tells me to do. I also LOVE Magic: The Gathering. Email me your favorite Commander and why itâ€™s your favorite.
