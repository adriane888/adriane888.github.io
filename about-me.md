## About Me
Hi, I’m Adriane Smith—a DevOps Engineer focused on automation, reliability, and cost-aware cloud architectures. I enjoy enabling teams with strong CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and observability, while keeping security and FinOps front-and-center.

### What I value
- People first, technology second
- Clarity and repeatability over ad hoc fixes
- Secure-by-default designs
- Fast feedback loops and developer experience

### Outside of work
I’m a learner, tinkerer, and coach—whether it’s experimenting with new workflows, mentoring teammates, or improving documentation so others can move faster.
